      expr: vector(1)
    ```

  - Add healtcheck configuration to karma:

    ```YAML
    alertmanager:
      servers:
        - name: am
          uri: https://alertmanager.example.com
          healthcheck:
            filters:
              prom1:
                - alertname=DeadMansSwitch
                - instance=prom1
              prom2:
                - alertname=DeadMansSwitch
                - instance=prom2
